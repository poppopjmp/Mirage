That sounds like an exciting project! Transitioning from a Python-based application like SpiderFoot to a microservices architecture in Rust is a significant undertaking, but it can lead to improved performance, scalability, and maintainability. Here are some steps and considerations to help you get started on your project, "Mirage":

### 1. Define the Scope and Requirements
- **Identify Features**: List all the features of SpiderFoot that you want to include in Mirage. Consider which features are essential and which can be added later.
- **User Stories**: Create user stories to understand how users will interact with the application. This will help guide your design decisions.

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Service Identification**: Break down the application into smaller, independent services. Each service should have a single responsibility (e.g., data collection, analysis, reporting).
- **Communication**: Decide how services will communicate (e.g., REST APIs, gRPC, message queues).
- **Data Management**: Determine how data will be stored and accessed. Consider using a database per service or a shared database, depending on your needs.

### 3. Technology Stack
- **Rust Frameworks**: Choose a Rust web framework for building your services (e.g., Actix, Rocket, or Warp).
- **Database**: Select a database that fits your needs (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
- **Containerization**: Consider using Docker to containerize your services for easier deployment and scaling.

### 4. Development Process
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and consider setting up a repository on GitHub or GitLab.
- **CI/CD**: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests for your services to ensure reliability.

### 5. Security Considerations
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- **Data Protection**: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

### 6. Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to document your APIs.
- **User Documentation**: Create user guides and technical documentation to help users and developers understand how to use and contribute to Mirage.

### 7. Community and Contributions
- **Open Source**: If you plan to make Mirage an open-source project, consider creating a CONTRIBUTING.md file to guide potential contributors.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage with the community through forums, social media, or a dedicated Discord/Slack channel.

### 8. Iterative Development
- **MVP Approach**: Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the core features. Gather feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.
- **Agile Methodology**: Consider using Agile methodologies to manage your development process, allowing for flexibility and adaptation as the project evolves.

### 9. Performance and Optimization
- **Profiling**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your Rust code and optimize performance.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure that your microservices can handle the expected traffic.

### 10. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Deployment Strategy**: Decide on a deployment strategy (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless).
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of your services.

### Conclusion
Transitioning from SpiderFoot to Mirage in Rust with a microservices architecture is a challenging but rewarding project. By following these steps and maintaining a clear vision, you can create a robust and scalable application. Good luck with your development, and feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions or need further assistance!
