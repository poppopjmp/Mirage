# Mirage Codebase Review Summary

This document summarizes the findings of a review of the Mirage codebase, focusing on the alignment between implementation and documentation, as well as the correctness of Dockerfile configurations.

## Architectural Overview

The Mirage platform is designed as a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific business capability. Key services include:

*   API Gateway
*   Auth Service
*   User Management Service
*   Scan Orchestration Service
*   Module Registry Service
*   Data Collection Service
*   Data Storage Service
*   Correlation Engine Service
*   Visualization Service
*   Reporting Service
*   Notification Service
*   Integration Service
*   Configuration Service
*   Discovery Service

## General Observations

*   The codebase generally adheres to the microservices architecture principles.
*   Most services are implemented in Rust using Actix-web, which aligns with the documented technology stack.
*   Some discrepancies exist between the documentation and the actual implementation, particularly in terms of database technologies and API endpoints.
*   Documentation coverage varies across services, with some services having more detailed documentation than others.

## Dockerfile Review Guidelines

The Dockerfiles are crucial for building and deploying the Mirage services. Here's a checklist of items to review in each Dockerfile:

*   **Base Image:**
    *   Use a minimal and secure base image (e.g., `rust:slim`, `node:alpine`, or distroless images).
    *   Avoid using `latest` tag for base images; pin to a specific version.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
    *   Use a package manager's lock file (e.g., `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    *   Minimize the number of layers by combining dependency installations.
*   **Application Code:**
    *   Copy only the necessary application code into the image.
    *   Use `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`).
*   **User:**
    *   Create a non-root user and run the application as that user for security.
*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Set environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the Dockerfile.
*   **Ports:**
    *   Expose the port that the application listens on.
*   **Command:**
    *   Use the `CMD` instruction to specify the command to run when the container starts.
*   **Multi-stage Builds:**
    *   Use multi-stage builds to reduce the image size by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.
*   **Image Size:**
    *   Keep the image size as small as possible to improve deployment speed and reduce storage costs.
*   **Security:**
    *   Run a vulnerability scan on the Docker image to identify and address any security issues.

**Review Steps:**

1.  **Locate Dockerfiles:** Find the `Dockerfile` in each service's directory.
2.  **Inspect Instructions:** Examine each instruction in the Dockerfile to ensure it follows the best practices outlined above.
3.  **Check for Optimizations:** Look for opportunities to optimize the Dockerfile, such as using multi-stage builds or reducing the number of layers.
4.  **Validate Configuration:** Ensure the Dockerfile correctly configures the application and sets the necessary environment variables.
5.  **Test Build:** Build the Docker image and run it locally to verify that the application starts correctly.

## Discrepancies and Recommendations

*   **Technology Stack Mismatch:** Several services are documented as being implemented in Go or Python, but are actually implemented in Rust. This needs to be corrected in the documentation.
*   **Dockerfile Review:** All Dockerfiles should be reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date, correctly configured, and optimized for production deployments.
*   **Documentation Completeness:** Documentation should be reviewed and updated to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation and provides sufficient detail for developers.

## Next Steps

1.  Update the `docs/services/README.md` and `architecture.md` files to reflect the correct technology stack for each service.
2.  Review and update the Dockerfiles for each service.
3.  Conduct a more detailed review of each service's implementation to identify any further discrepancies or areas for improvement.
