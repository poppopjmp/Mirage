# Deployment Model

Mirage is designed to be deployed in containerized environments using:
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment management
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

## Security Considerations

- All inter-service communication is encrypted
- Least privilege access for all services
- Regular security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Secrets management through secure vaults
- Comprehensive audit logging
