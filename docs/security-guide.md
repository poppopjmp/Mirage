# Mirage Security Guide

This document outlines the security architecture, best practices, and considerations for the Mirage platform.

## Security Architecture

Mirage implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

1. **Network Security**: Network isolation and segmentation
2. **Application Security**: Secure coding practices and input validation
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
4. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
5. **Operational Security**: Monitoring, logging, and incident response

## Network Security

### API Gateway

All external requests enter through the API Gateway, which provides:

- TLS termination
- IP address filtering
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- DDoS protection

### Network Policies

In Kubernetes environments, network policies restrict pod-to-pod communication:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: mirage-default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: mirage-allow-internal
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: mirage
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/part-of: mirage
```

### Service Mesh

For advanced scenarios, a service mesh (Istio or Linkerd) provides:

- Mutual TLS between services
- Fine-grained traffic policies
- Circuit breaking
- Request authorization

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Methods

Mirage supports multiple authentication methods:

- Username/password with strong password policies
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration
- SAML for enterprise SSO
- API keys for automated access
- Multi-factor authentication

### JWT-based Session Management

- JWT tokens issued upon successful authentication
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Token revocation capability

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access control is applied at multiple levels:

1. **Roles**: Admin, Analyst, User, Read-only
2. **Organizations**: Multi-tenant separation
3. **Teams**: Collaborative groups within organizations
4. **Projects**: Collections of related scans and data
5. **Resources**: Individual scans, reports, etc.

Example role definition:

```json
{
  "role": "analyst",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "resource": "scans",
      "actions": ["read", "create", "update"],
      "constraints": {
        "team": "${user.teams}"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": "reports",
      "actions": ["read", "create"],
      "constraints": {
        "team": "${user.teams}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest

- Database encryption using transparent data encryption (TDE)
- Filesystem encryption for persistent volumes
- Encrypted backups

### Encryption in Transit

- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP traffic
- TLS for database connections
- TLS for message queue connections

### Sensitive Data Handling

- PII detection and masking
- Separate storage for API keys and credentials
- Automatic secrets rotation

## Operational Security

### Secure CI/CD Pipeline

- Code scanning for vulnerabilities
- Container image scanning
- Software composition analysis
- Infrastructure as code security scanning

### Monitoring & Detection

- Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual activity
- Integration with SIEM platforms

### Incident Response

- Automated alerting for security events
- Defined incident response procedures
- Regular security drills

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Scanning

- Regular application security scanning
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Network security scanning
- Compliance checking

### Patch Management

- Critical security patches applied within 24 hours
- Regular update cycle for non-critical patches
- Automatic updates for dependencies where appropriate

## Security Hardening

### Container Security

- Non-root container execution
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Minimal base images
- Resource limitations

Example Dockerfile security practices:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder

# Set up virtual environment
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim AS runner

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -g 999 appuser && \
    useradd -r -u 999 -g appuser appuser

# Copy virtual environment
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser ./app /app

WORKDIR /app
USER appuser

CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app"]
```

### Kubernetes Security

- Pod security policies
- Service account with minimal privileges
- Secret management with external vault integration

### Host Security

- Minimal host OS
- Regular OS patching
- Host-based intrusion detection

## Compliance Considerations

Mirage is designed to help organizations comply with:

- ISO 27001
- SOC 2
- GDPR
- HIPAA (when handling health information)
- PCI DSS (when handling payment information)

## Security Development Lifecycle

1. **Training**: Security awareness training for all developers
2. **Design**: Threat modeling and security reviews
3. **Implementation**: Secure coding practices, peer reviews
4. **Verification**: Security testing, code scanning
5. **Release**: Final security review
6. **Maintenance**: Ongoing vulnerability management

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Mirage, please report it responsibly to:

security@mirage.io

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process:
1. Report issue privately
2. Issue confirmed and fixed
3. Update released
4. Public disclosure after users have had time to update
